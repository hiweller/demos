# Demo and workshop materials

This repository is a transformer! It's an all-purpose repository for various demo and workshop materials, to avoid repository creep. The only repository creep around here should be me.



## Use instructions

Log into a terminal (or use GitHub desktop) to clone the repository, and then open the .Rproj file in RStudio:

```{R}
$ git clone https://github.com/hiweller/stats_workshops
$ rstudio stats_workshops.Rproj
```

Otherwise, you can just toy around with the individual scripts & datasets.
